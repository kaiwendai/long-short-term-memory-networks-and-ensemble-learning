# long-short-term-memory-networks-and-ensemble-learning
In this project we implemented a long-short term memory (LSTM) model from scratch and train them for the language modeling task. We then performed some error analysis and ablation studies on the learnt model. In the second part, we trained an ensemble of neural networks for classifying hand written digits in the MNIST dataset.
